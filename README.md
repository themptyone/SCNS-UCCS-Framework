# SCNS–UCCS Framework

The **SCNS–UCCS Framework** provides a structured approach to organizing and coordinating projects. It ensures that every component has a clear identity, consistent rules, and a place within a broader system.

---

## What It Is
- **SCNS** — *Spatial Code Navigation System*: a method for labeling and mapping project elements.  
- **UCCS** — *Universal Code Coordination System*: a set of protocols that define how these elements are maintained and interact.  

Together, they create a framework that is both **navigable** and **cohesive**.

---

## Why It Matters
Modern projects quickly grow in complexity. Without structure, information becomes scattered, duplicated, or lost.  
The SCNS–UCCS framework addresses this by providing:

- **Clarity** — Every item can be uniquely identified.  
- **Consistency** — Protocols keep documents and processes aligned.  
- **Scalability** — The system adapts as projects expand.  
- **Collaboration** — A shared structure improves communication across teams.  

---

## How It Works
At the foundation are **SCNS identifiers (IDs):**

```
$PROJECT:SECTION:DETAIL:N0001$
```

Each ID represents a specific element — whether that is a file, a protocol, or a block of information.  

These IDs are governed by **UCCS protocols**, which define rules for their use, validation, and organization.  
- SCNS provides **location and identity**.  
- UCCS provides **rules and structure**.  

---

## Example
```markdown
SCNS ID: $COOKIE-CLUB:RECIPE:INGREDIENTS:N0020$

1 cup butter  
½ cup sugar  
2 cups flour
```

This recipe block is uniquely labeled. It can be referenced, reorganized, or validated across documents without ambiguity.  

---

## Applications
The framework is flexible and not tied to a single language or field. It can be applied to:  
- Software and AI workflows  
- Research documentation  
- Large-scale project coordination  
- Systems design and knowledge management  

---

## Documentation
Detailed specifications and protocols are available in the [docs/](./docs) directory.  
Examples, project templates, and protocol files are included for quick adoption.  

---

## Vision
The SCNS–UCCS framework is designed to create **order within complexity**.  
It is more than a filing method: it is a living coordination system that grows with your projects, keeping them transparent, accountable, and scalable.
