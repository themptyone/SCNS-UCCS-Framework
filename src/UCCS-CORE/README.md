# UCCS Core Concept Framework

The **Universal Coordinate Classification System (UCCS)** is a comprehensive framework for organizing, navigating, and validating information. It merges architectural design, implementation details, and advanced execution protocols into a unified structure.

This repository contains the core specification (`UCCS-CORE0021.md`) defining how UCCS ensures Universal Addressability, User Sovereignty, and protocol-driven collaboration across AI-human systems.

## 📖 What is UCCS?

UCCS provides a coordinate-based approach to managing information. Instead of fragile file paths or line numbers, UCCS assigns stable SCNS coordinates to every block of data, making it traceable, extensible, and resilient to change.

### Core Principles

- **Conservation of Context** – every element has coordinates
- **Persistence Through Change** – coordinates survive refactoring
- **Relational Integrity** – all relationships are explicit and trackable
- **Purpose Primacy** – classification is based on intent, not syntax
- **Universal Addressability** – any unit of information can be precisely located
- **User Sovereignty** – no major change without explicit confirmation (via UIP)

## 🔑 Key Features

### Universal Interaction Protocol (UIP)
A strict 5-step control loop:
```
GENERATE → SUMMARIZE → PREVIEW → CONFIRM → ITERATE
```

### SCNS-V4 Coordinate System
Domain-agnostic format:
```
[DOMAIN]:[AREA]:[COMPONENT]:[ELEMENT]:[TAG]:[SEQUENCE][:VERSION][:STATE]
```

### Cross-Reference System (RTAGs)
Defines relationships like `REF`, `DEPENDS`, `CALLS`, and `RANGE`.

### Algorithms for Stability
- Dynamic insertion for safe coordinate extension
- Cross-reference resolution with dependency graphs
- Collision detection & resolution
- Performance optimizations with caching

### Protocol Architecture
Layers for governance, navigation, AI collaboration, deployment, and maintenance.

## 🚀 Use Cases

- **AI-Human Collaboration** – Ensure sovereignty and traceability in AI outputs
- **Software Development** – Manage evolving codebases with stable references
- **Knowledge Systems** – Build navigable, cross-referenced information spaces
- **Governance** – Enforce validation, audit trails, and compliance

## 📊 Success Metrics

- **File Coverage** – % of files with SCNS IDs
- **Reference Accuracy** – % of valid cross-references
- **User Confirmation Rate** – Y/N/Modify patterns at UIP gates
- **Navigation Ease & Clarity** – Qualitative indicators from users
