# UCCS Core Framework - Segmented Document

## 1. Overview

Each file represents a logical "byte-sized" block of the original document, complete with a unique **SCNS V4 coordinate** for easy navigation, reference, and integration with other UCCS protocols.

## 3. How to Use These Files

1.  **Navigate by Topic**: Use the filenames and descriptions in the index above to find the specific section you need.
2.  **Trace Dependencies**: Refer to the SCNS IDs within each file to understand the relationships between different blocks of information.
3.  **Reconstruct**: The files are numbered sequentially, allowing you to read them in order to reconstruct the flow of the original document.

This modular structure is designed to make the information easier to process, update, and integrate into automated workflows.
