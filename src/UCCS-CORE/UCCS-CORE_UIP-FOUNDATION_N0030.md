## Universal Interaction Protocol (UIP) - Foundation Principle

**SCNS ID:** `$UCCS-CORE:CONCEPT:UIP:FOUNDATION:PRINCIPLE:N0070$`

**The UIP applies to ALL protocols, sub-protocols, and AI interactions:**

GENERATE → SUMMARIZE → PREVIEW → CONFIRM → ITERATE


### UIP Block-by-Block Control

Every significant action follows this pattern:
1.  **Generate** content/structure/analysis
2.  **Summarize** what was accomplished (1-3 lines)
3.  **Preview** the result for user review
4.  **Confirm** with user: "Proceed? (Y / N / Modify)"
5.  **Iterate** based on response - continue, stop, or modify

This creates "productive friction" - more granular control without slowing the system down.
