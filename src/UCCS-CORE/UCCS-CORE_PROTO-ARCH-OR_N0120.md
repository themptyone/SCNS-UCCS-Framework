## Protocol Architecture

**SCNS ID:** `$UCCS-CORE:ARCH:PROTOCOL:ARCHITECTURE:PROTOCOL:N0190$`

### PHASE 1: UCCS-ORG-INITIALIZE → File Discovery & Cataloging

**UIP Block: File Discovery**
```yaml
BLOCK:
  scns_id: "UCCS-ORG:org:CATALOG:N0200"
  title: "File Discovery & Initial Cataloging"
  purpose: "Scan and register all files in workspace with SCNS addressing"
  process:
    - SCAN: Discover all files in specified directory/workspace
    - CLASSIFY: Determine file types and suggested SCNS categories
    - REGISTER: Assign preliminary SCNS IDs based on content analysis
    - VALIDATE: Present catalog for user confirmation
  confirmation: "Proceed with file registration? (Y / N / Modify)"
```
  
PHASE 2: UCCS-ORG-STRUCTURE → Cross-Reference Matrix Creation

UIP Block: Relationship Mapping

```yaml

BLOCK:
  scns_id: "UCCS-ORG:org:MATRIX:N0210"
  title: "Cross-Reference Matrix Generation"
  purpose: "Map relationships between files using RTAG analysis"
  process:
    - ANALYZE: Parse files for SCNS IDs and RTAG references
    - MAP: Create relationship matrix (REF, DEPENDS, CALLS, EXTENDS)
    - VISUALIZE: Generate navigable cross-reference table
    - VALIDATE: Confirm relationship accuracy
  confirmation: "Accept relationship mapping? (Y / N / Modify)"
```

PHASE 3: UCCS-ORG-MAINTAIN → Dynamic Organization Management

UIP Block: Continuous Organization

```yaml
BLOCK:
  scns_id: "UCCS-ORG:org:MAINTAIN:N0220"
  title: "Dynamic File Organization Maintenance"
  purpose: "Keep organization current as files change"
  process:
    - MONITOR: Track file additions, modifications, deletions
    - UPDATE: Refresh SCNS IDs and cross-references automatically
    - RECONCILE: Resolve conflicts and broken references
    - REPORT: Provide organization health status
  confirmation: "Apply organization updates? (Y / N / Modify)"
```
