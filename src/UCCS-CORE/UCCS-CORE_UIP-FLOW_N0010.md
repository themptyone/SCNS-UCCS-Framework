## Universal Interaction Protocol (UIP) Flow

**SCNS ID:** `$UCCS-CORE:SPEC:FRAMEWORK:UIP-FLOW:FLOW:N0020$`

### Summary
The UIP is the mandatory, non-negotiable interaction pattern for all significant actions within the UCCS ecosystem. It ensures user control through a consistent five-step process: Generate, Summarize, Preview, Confirm, and Iterate.

### Elaboration
The Universal Interaction Protocol (UIP) is the foundational mechanism for ensuring User Sovereignty across all UCCS protocols and AI interactions. Every significant action that creates or modifies a block of information must follow a strict, five-step control flow:
* GENERATE: The AI agent creates the content for a discrete work unit.
* SUMMARIZE: The AI provides a concise, 1-3 line summary of what was just accomplished.
* PREVIEW: The complete result is shown to the user for review.
* CONFIRM: The AI must pause and explicitly ask for user validation with the mandatory prompt: "Proceed? (Y/N/Modify)".
* ITERATE: Based on the user's response, the AI continues (Y), stops (N), or applies requested changes and repeats the loop (Modify).


This protocol is enforced through "UIP Gates," which are mandatory checkpoints for user validation before any critical action can be completed.
