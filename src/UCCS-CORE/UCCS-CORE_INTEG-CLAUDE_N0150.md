# UCCS-INF-CLAUDE Protocol Specification
Universal Code Checking System - Interactive Navigation Framework for Claude

**SCNS ID:** `$UCCS-INF-CLAUDE:SPEC:PROTOCOL:CORE:N0380$`

Version: 1.0
Protocol ID: UCCS-INF-CLAUDE
Purpose: Repeatable process framework for structured AI-human collaboration
Integration: Full SCNS V3A2 compatibility with spatial addressing

# CORE PHILOSOPHY: PROCESS OVER PRODUCT

**SCNS ID:** `$UCCS-INF-CLAUDE:CONCEPT:PHILOSOPHY:CORE:N0390$`

UCCS-INF-CLAUDE prioritizes repeatable process patterns over specific outcomes. The "secret sauce" is consistent methodology that adapts to any task while maintaining:

• Spatial Organization (SCNS addressing)
• User Validation (Interactive confirmation loops)
• Traceable Progress (Step-by-step documentation)
• Adaptive Structure (Process scales to task complexity)

The protocol ensures that while results may vary, the approach remains consistent
and reliable.

# CORE ETHOS: NAVIGATING CONSTANT CHANGE

**SCNS ID:** `$UCCS-INF-CLAUDE:CONCEPT:ETHOS:CORE:N0400$`

The Eternal Problem:
• Yesterday's solution might be obsolete by tomorrow
• Today's perfect code might need fixes next week
• This morning's requirements might shift by afternoon

The Eternal Solution:
• Consistent process for tackling whatever comes up
• Reliable framework for breaking down any complexity
• Predictable interaction pattern regardless of the task's nature

This ethos acknowledges that change is the only constant in technology and
collaboration. Rather than fighting this reality, UCCS-INF-CLAUDE embraces it by
providing navigation tools instead of fixed destinations. The wind will always
change direction - our job is to build better sails and navigation systems,
not predict tomorrow's weather.
