# SCNS V4 - Spatial Code Navigation System

This repository contains the complete definitions and documentation for **SCNS V4**, a revolutionary approach to organizing and navigating information that treats code, documents, and data as **spatial entities** rather than linear text.

## 📌 What is SCNS?

SCNS is like a **GPS system for your information**.  
Instead of relying on fragile file paths and line numbers that break when code is refactored, SCNS assigns a **stable, hierarchical coordinate** to every discrete unit of information.  

This foundational principle is called **Universal Addressability**.

## ❌ The Problem

Traditional file systems and references break down when:

- Files are reorganized or renamed
- Code is refactored across multiple files
- Teams need to collaborate on complex projects
- AI systems need to understand relationships between components

---

## ✅ The SCNS Solution

SCNS provides **stable coordinates** that survive changes to the underlying structure.

**Example:**

- Traditional Path:  
  `folder1/subfolder1/file1.txt (line 47)`
- SCNS Coordinate:  
  `$MYPROJECT:AUTH:LOGIN:VALIDATION:N0010$`

Even if the file is moved or refactored, the SCNS coordinate remains the same.

## 🪜 The Three Pillars of SCNS

1. **Spatial Intelligence** → Information has relationships and positioning, not just content.  
2. **Coordinate Stability** → Addresses survive refactoring, reorganization, and evolution.  
3. **Universal Compatibility** → Any system, language, or tool can adopt SCNS addressing.

## 🧩 SCNS V4 Format Specification

SCNS-V4 uses a **six-part hierarchical coordinate system**:

$DOMAIN:AREA:COMPONENT:ELEMENT:TAG:SEQUENCE$


### Component Breakdown

- **DOMAIN** → Highest-level project/system (e.g., `WEBAPP`, `FINTECH`)  
- **AREA** → Major functional area (e.g., `AUTH`, `UI`, `API`)  
- **COMPONENT** → Specific module/service (e.g., `LOGIN`, `DATABASE`)  
- **ELEMENT** → Self-contained block of info (e.g., `VALIDATION`, `RENDER`)  
- **TAG** → Functional role (e.g., `FUNC`, `DATA`, `CTRL`, `ERR`)  
- **SEQUENCE** → Numeric identifier for ordering (`N0010`, `N0020`)  

### Optional Dimensional Tags

- **Version Tag** → Tracks revisions (e.g., `:V1.2.3`)  
- **State Tag** → Lifecycle status (e.g., `:DRAFT`, `:ACTIVE`, `:DEPRECATED`)

## 🛠 Practical Example

Embed SCNS coordinates directly in code for spatial context:

```javascript
// SCNS: $WEBAPP:AUTH:VALIDATION:EMAIL:N0010$
function validateUser(email) {
  return email.includes('@');
}
```
